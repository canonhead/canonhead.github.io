                <h2>Regularity of Weak Solutions to Uniformly Elliptic Partial Differential Equations: An Exploration of the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser Theorem</h2>
                <h3>Undergraduate Thesis in Mathematics</h3>
                <p>
                    My undergraduate thesis written as part of the Mathematics degree at Columbia University, was advised by Professor Daniela De Silva. The abstract is as follows.<br><br>
                    Problems in partial differential equations are motivated by a wide range of research fields, including more mathematical ones like calculus of variations, or topics in applied sciences. Many of these problems require finding classical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). These solutions are often challenging to prove the existence of, unlike weak solutions which can be calculated through generalized methods. Proving that weak solutions are sufficiently regular to qualify as classical solutions changes the key problem: instead of trying to prove existence, the focus shifts to proving regularity. This process therefore provides a very effective method to find classical solutions. This thesis is an expository survey aimed at readers with an advanced undergraduate's level of familiarity with concepts in mathematical analysis and partial differential equations, and focuses on the regularity of weak solutions to uniformly elliptic partial differential equations of second order. Throughout this work, Sobolev spaces are utilized to explore the weak solutions, and the work culminates in the proof of the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser Theorem. This theorem proves that weak solutions are HÃ¶lder regular and streamlines the process of finding classical solutions to uniformly elliptic partial differential equations, including the minimal surface equation.
